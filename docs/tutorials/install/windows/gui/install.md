# Installation Using the Graphical Interface

The steps to install the HIP SDK for Windows are described in this document.

## System Requirements

The HIP SDK is supported on Windows 10 and 11. The HIP SDK may be installed on a
system without AMD GPUs to use the build toolchains. To run HIP applications, a
compatible GPU is required. Please see the supported GPU guide for more details.

## HIP SDK Installation

### Download the installer

Download the installer from the
[HIP-SDK download page](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html).

### Launching the installer

To launch the AMD HIP SDK Installer, click the **Setup** icon shown in the following image.

```{figure} ../../../../data/tutorials/install/windows/000-setup-icon.png
:name: setup-icon-install
:alt: Icon with AMD arrow logo and User Access Control Shield overlayed.

```

The installer requires Administrator Privileges, so you may be greeted with a
User Access Control (UAC) pop-up. Click Yes.

```{figure} ../../../../data/tutorials/install/windows/001-uac-dark.png
:name: uac-dark-install
:class: only-dark

:name: uac-light-install
:class: only-light
:alt: User Access Control pop-up

```

The installer executable will temporarily extract installer packages to `C:\AMD`
which it will remove after installation completes. This extraction is signified
by the "Initializing install" window in the following image.

```

The installer will then detect your system configuration to determine which installable components
are applicable to your system.

```

### Customizing the install

When the installer launches, it displays a window that lets the user customize
the installation. By default, all components are selected for installation.
Refer to the following image for an instance when the Select All option
is turned on.

#### HIP SDK Installer

The HIP SDK installation options are listed in the following table.

```{table} HIP SDK Components for Installation
:name: hip-sdk-options
| **HIP Components** | **Install Type** | **Additional Options** |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------------:|
| HIP SDK Core         | 5.5.0               | Install location                        |
| HIP Libraries        | Full, Partial, None | Runtime, Development (Libs and headers) |
| HIP Runtime Compiler | Full, Partial, None | Runtime, Development (Headers)          |
| HIP Ray Tracing      | Full, Partial, None | Runtime, Development (Headers)          |
| Visual Studio Plugin | Full, Partial, None | Visual Studio 2017, 2019, 2022 Plugin   |
```

```{note}
The Select/DeSelect All option only applies to the installation of HIP SDK
components. To install the bundled AMD Display Driver, manually select the
install type.
```

```{tip}
Should you only wish to install a few select components,
DeSelecting All and then picking the individual components may be more
convenient.
```

#### AMD Display Driver

The HIP SDK installer bundles an AMD Radeon Software PRO 23.10 installer. The
supported install options are summarized in the following table:

```{table} AMD Display Driver Install Options
:name: display-driver-install-options
| **Install Option** | **Description** |
|:------------------:|:---------------:|
| Install Location         | Location on disk to store driver files. |
| Install Type             | The breadth of components to be installed. |
| Factory Reset (Optional) | A Factory Reset will remove all prior versions of AMD HIP SDK and drivers. You will not be able to roll back to previously installed drivers. |
```

```{table} AMD Display Driver Install Types
:name: display-driver-install-types
| **Install Type** | **Description** |
|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| Full Install     | Provides all AMD Software features and controls for gaming, recording, streaming, and tweaking the performance on your graphics hardware. |
| Minimal Install  | Provides only the basic controls for AMD Software features and does not include advanced features such as performance tweaking or recording and capturing content. |
| Driver Only      | Provides no user interface for AMD Software features. |
```

```{note}
You must perform a system restart for a complete installation of the
Display Driver.
```

### Installing Components

Please wait for the installation to complete during as shown in the following image.

```{figure} ../../../../data/tutorials/install/windows/012-install-progress.png
:name: install-progress
:alt: Window with AMD arrow logo, futuristic background and progress meter.

```

### Installation Complete

Once the installation is complete, the installer window may prompt you for a
system restart. Click **Restart** at the lower right corner, shown in the following image.

```{figure} ../../../../data/tutorials/install/windows/013-install-complete.png
:name: install-complete
:alt: Window with AMD arrow logo, futuristic background and completion notice.
Installation Complete
```

```{error}
Should the installer terminate due to unexpcted circumstances, or the user
forcibly terminates the installer, the temporary directory created under
`C:\AMD` may be safely removed. Installed components will not depend on this
folder (unless the user specifies `C:\AMD` as an install folder explicitly).
```
